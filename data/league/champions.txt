She cripples her quarry before pouncing on them in feline form—the lucky few who survive tell tales of a wild woman with razor-sharp instincts, and even sharper claws... Use brush to your advantage!

Prompt: Kledthe Cantankerous Cavalier A warrior as fearless as he is ornery, the yordle Kled embodies the furious bravado of Noxus. He is an icon beloved by the empire's soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has “acquired” every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what's his… and to take whatever he can get. Kled generates some courage by killing minions, but gets much more from fighting Champions. The last hit of Violent Tendencies deals more damage than the first three - make sure you hit it! Chaaaaaaaarge!!! can be cast at a great range. Try and predict where the enemy team will be by the time you reach them.    Kled generates courage by damaging enemies with his Pocket Pistol and basic attacks, killing minions, and attacking structures or epic monsters. Watch Kled's courage bar when he's off his mount - when it reaches 100%, he will remount and regain a significant amount of health. Kled is much more threatening when he has Violent Tendencies ready. Fighter, Tank Kled throws a bear trap that damages and hooks an enemy champion. If shackled for a short duration, the target takes additional physical damage and is yanked toward Kled.<br><br>When dismounted, this ability is replaced by Pocket Pistol, a ranged gun blast that knocks back Kled and restores courage.

Prompt: LeeSin the Blind Monk A master of Ionia's ancient martial arts, Lee Sin is a principled fighter who channels the essence of the dragon spirit to face any challenge. Though he lost his sight many years ago, the warrior-monk has devoted his life to protecting his homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance. Enemies who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse kicks. Use Sonic Wave before Dragon's Rage so you can chase the target with Resonating Strike. Take advantage of Flurry by weaving in basic attacks between spell casts - this maximizes damage output and minimizes Energy loss. Self-casting Safeguard and using Iron Will are powerful tools for killing neutral monsters (in the jungle)." Stay spread out to minimize the impact of Lee Sin's ultimate, Dragon's Rage. Lee Sin has powerful tools to combat physical damage in Iron Will and Cripple but he is still vulnerable to magic damage. Lee Sin relies heavily on following up with his abilities. Use disables to prevent him from chaining together his abilities and attacks. Fighter, Assassin Sonic Wave: Lee Sin projects a discordant wave of sound to locate his enemies, dealing physical damage to the first enemy it encounters. If Sonic Wave hits, Lee Sin can cast Resonating Strike for the next 3 seconds.<br>Resonating Strike: Lee Sin dashes to the enemy hit by Sonic Wave, dealing physical damage based on the target's missing Health. Safeguard: Lee Sin rushes to target ally, shielding himself from damage. If the ally is a champion, they are also shielded. After using Safeguard, Lee Sin can cast Iron Will for the next 3 seconds.<br>Iron Will: Lee Sin's intense training allows him to thrive in battle. For 4 seconds, Lee Sin gains Life Steal and Spell Vamp. Tempest: Lee Sin smashes the ground, sending out a shockwave that deals magic damage and reveals enemy units hit. If Tempest hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast cripple for the next 3 seconds.<br>Cripple: Lee Sin cripples nearby enemies damaged by Tempest, reducing their Move Speed for 4 seconds. Move Speed recovers gradually over the duration. Lee Sin performs a powerful roundhouse kick launching his target back, dealing physical damage to the target and any enemies they collide with. Enemies the target collides with are knocked into the air for a short duration. This technique was taught to him by Jesse Perring, although Lee Sin does not kick players off the map. After Lee Sin uses an ability, his next 2 basic attacks gain Attack Speed and return Energy.

Prompt: Lulu the Fae Sorceress The yordle mage Lulu is known for conjuring dreamlike illusions and fanciful creatures as she roams Runeterra with her fairy companion Pix. Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world, and what she views as the constraints of this mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her magic at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment. Glitterlance can be fired at odd angles depending on where your cursor is - Moving your cursor closer to Pix and Lulu will change your area of effect size considerably. Consider casting Help, Pix! on ranged attackers for the Pix boost and Wild Growth on Tanks or Fighters for the added initiation power. The shots from Lulu's faerie can be intercepted - hide behind your minions to avoid the additional Faerie attacks. Lulu excels when opponents heavily commit. Don't give her this chance! Use heavy harass tactics instead to force Lulu and her partner out of lane. Support, Mage Pix and Lulu each fire a bolt of magical energy that damages and heavily slows all enemies it hits. If cast on an ally, grants them Attack Speed and Move Speed for a short time. If cast on an enemy, turns them into an adorable critter that can't attack or cast spells. If cast on an ally, commands Pix to jump to an ally and shield them. He then follows them and aids their attacks. If cast on an enemy, commands Pix to jump to an enemy and damage them. He then follows them and grants you vision of that enemy. Lulu enlarges an ally, knocking nearby enemies into the air and granting the ally a large amount of bonus health. For the next few seconds, that ally gains an aura that slows nearby enemies. Pix fires magical bolts of energy whenever the champion he's following attacks another enemy unit. These bolts are homing, but can be intercepted by other units.

Though he chooses to enter into violence only as a last resort, the grace and speed of his blade ensures resolution is always swift.

Prompt: One of the ancient darkin, Varus was a deadly killer who loved to torment his foes, driving them almost to insanity before delivering the killing arrow. He was imprisoned at the end of the Great Darkin War, but escaped centuries later in the remade flesh of two Ionian hunters—they had unwittingly released him, cursed to bear the bow containing his bound essence. Varus now seeks out those who trapped him, in order to enact his brutal vengeance, but the mortal souls within still resist him every step of the way. Varus readies and then fires a powerful shot that gains extra range and damage the longer he spends preparing to fire. Passive: Varus' basic attacks deal bonus magic damage and apply Blight. Varus' other abilities detonate Blight, dealing magic damage based on the target's maximum Health. Active: Varus empowers his next Piercing Arrow. Varus fires a hail of arrows that deal physical damage and desecrate the ground. Desecrated ground slows enemies' Move Speed and reduces their self healing and regeneration. Varus flings out a damaging tendril of corruption that immobilizes the first enemy champion hit and then spreads towards nearby uninfected champions, immobilizing them too on contact. On kill or assist, Varus temporarily gains Attack Speed. This bonus is larger if the enemy is a champion.
